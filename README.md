This repository contains the code for visual exploration of computer science research communities.

## Data
We use the citation network data from the DBLP network, which we accessed through [this link](https://aminer.org/citation). We put the data in a folder called `python/data/`, which is hidden with our `.gitignore` file. You can download the data by running `./get_data.sh`

## Graphs
You can access archived versions of the graph in the `python/graphs/` folder.
